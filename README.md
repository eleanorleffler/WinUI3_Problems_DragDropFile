# WinUI3_Problems_DragDropFile

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the drag and drop capability onto a Grid in both UWP and WinUI3 Desktop.

The UWP sample code works as expected. However, the WinUI3 Desktop sample code does not allow the user to drop the file onto the Grid.
